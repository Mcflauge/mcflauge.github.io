            Chicago is a city known for violence. It held the title of murder capital in the nation and portrayed 47,591 crimes in 2021. Throughout all of this unforeseeable danger there is also upward progression. Before interviewing Jonathan, I had the chance to interview a gentleman who was born and raised in the mid 1900's. Chicago is a whole different city now compared to back then. He told me how he was able to bike from the southside to his place and everyone was so kind, and he would never lock his house because there wouldn't be burglaries in his neighborhood. It sounded surreal to me to hear so many positive things about our city, but that can all come back with time and effort. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has implimented a plan, which prices out at around 410 million, to work on the overall saftey of the city. Through time and help of many Chicagoans, I believe our city can prosper and become what it once was. This is Chicago, our city and the start of Jonathan's journey.
